# DesignPatterns
Repository for assignments, examples, and project for the CS 542 Design Patterns class from CSUSM


### Concept:
Design Patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context. 

Design Pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design, a description for how to solve a problem that can be customizable. 


### Design Techniques:

1. Favor composition over inheritance to promote encapsulation - instead of creating child classes

2. Use interface classes for providing a common interface. Program through interface, not in the concrete level. Refer through the interface, not directly. 


### Classification by Purpose:

1. Creational Patterns: for object creation

2. Structural Patterns: for compositions of classes and objects

3. Behavioral Patterns: for interactions of classes and objects


### Each pattern has 4 essential elements:
  - name
  - problem (application scope, what type of problem it addresses), 
  - solution (how this DP works), 
  - consequences (costs, limitations, and benefits)
